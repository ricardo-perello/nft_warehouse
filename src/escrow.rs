//! A component that stores funds for you and lets you access them
//! yourself or issue Allowance NFTs to let others access them.
//!
//! Think of an Escrow as an account component external to your
//! wallet, which is nevertheless under your control. You can use this
//! Escrow as a central place to hold funds that go into a variety of
//! services.
//!
//! You can issue Allowance NFTs towards your Escrow and give those
//! Allowances to others. Each Allowance NFT acts a bit like an IOU
//! that the holder can use to extract funds from your Escrow, for as
//! long as funds last.
//!
//! You could for example put 10k XRD into an Escrow, issue an
//! Allowance for 10k XRD and give to your son, and another Allowance
//! also for 10k XRD and give to your daughter. You explain to them
//! that these are emergency funds they can dip into if they get into
//! an emergency situation while travelling. You don't expect these
//! funds to ever actually get used, but they are there in full for
//! each of your two kids should the emergency ever arise.
//!
//! A single Escrow component can hold any amount of token pools, each
//! associated with an owner badge. That is, Alice can have a token
//! pool where she stores all sorts of different tokens while Bob can
//! also have a token pool on the same Escrow component instance that
//! Alice does. And of course, Alice or Bob could even have multiple
//! such sets of pools tied to different ownership badges still on the
//! same Escrow instance. (In principle there is no reason the world
//! should need more than a single instance of this component.) For
//! this reason, when interacting with an Escrow instance you always
//! need to know which owner badge to access, and which resource type
//! you're interested in.
//!
//! # Some use cases
//!
//! ## Curbing your enthusiasm
//!
//! You could put funds into Escrow intended for playing an online
//! game and issue an Allowance to that game that lets it charge its
//! fees off of the Escrow. By disassociating these payments from your
//! main account you can feel more safe about giving the game direct
//! access to funds (since the Escrow only holds as much funds as you
//! put there), and the Allowance system gives you fine grained
//! control over how much and how often the game can charge you. Or
//! you can use it to curb your own excitement: if you set it up so
//! the game can at max extract, say, 100 XRD per month, then this
//! effectively caps how much you end up spending on the game when
//! otherwise the excitement of the moment might have you spending
//! hundreds in a week without even realizing what's going on before
//! it's too late.
//!
//! ## Central trading account
//!
//! You can use an Escrow as a central repository of funds that you
//! use for trading activities. Markets that recognize the Escrow
//! concept can make payouts for completed deals into the Escrow
//! (instead of e.g. holding it inside their own internal vaults until
//! you come to collect), and can pull funds for covering your trade
//! deals also from the same Escrow. You could set this up to be
//! self-perpetuating (if your trades are clever enough) in that the
//! funds that go into the Escrow from completed deals fund your
//! future deals that are being taken from the same Escrow. Then every
//! once in a while you can drop by and skim off some of the profits
//! that have been happening since last payday.
//!
//! ## Selling all your tokens on all the exchanges
//!
//! If you're selling a million tokens of some type then instead of
//! putting them all on a single exchange, and instead of having to
//! meticulously distribute them across multiple exchanges, you can
//! put your million tokens in an Escrow and put an Allowance for a
//! million tokens on every exchange in the world. *All* the exchanges
//! can then offer your million tokens for sale, and all of them will
//! be pulling from your Escrow to fulfill trades. Once the Escrow is
//! empty, the exchanges will automatically no longer be doing those
//! trades because pulling from the Escrow will yield nothing.
//!
//! Note that test scenario 1 demonstrates this type of use case.
//!
//! ## Offering to buy more than you can afford
//!
//! You could use an Escrow to set up more trade deals than you can
//! technically afford, by setting up Allowance-backed trade deals
//! that are only going to actually be completed for so long as the
//! Escrow holds the necessary funds. Maybe you have 10,000 XRD and
//! you want to buy either USD or EURO stablecoins depending on which
//! drops below a certain threshold first. You set up one limit buy
//! for 10k XRD worth of USD, and one limit buy for 10k XRD worth of
//! EURO, each backed by Allowances that can pull the full 10k XRD in
//! your Escrow. Whichever of those happens first will pull all your
//! funds (and then even if the other happens later the trade won't go
//! through because you'll be out of funds). Contrast this to having
//! to bind up XRD into each limit buy in which case you'd end up with
//! a 5k XRD limit buy of USD and a 5k XRD limit buy of EURO.
//!
//! Note that test scenario 2 demonstrates this type of use case.
//!
//! ## Giving someone a (traditional) allowance account
//!
//! You could set up an Escrow as a funding mechanism for someone
//! you're helping finance, putting funds into the Escrow and giving
//! them an Allowance to extract those funds. This would give you
//! control over their use of the funds (through Allowance rules)
//! without them having to involve you directly every single time they
//! need to make a withdrawal.
//!
//! # Subsidies
//!
//! You can subsidize (internally it uses `lock_fee` or
//! `lock_contingent_fee`) the current transaction by pulling funds
//! from your Escrow, using the [subsidize] and [subsidize_contingent]
//! functions.
//!
//! You can also allow others to subsidize transactions by giving them
//! an Allowance and having them use [subsidize_with_allowance] to
//! pull XRD from your Escrow to run their transactions. You might be
//! doing this as a marketing stunt, or it may be a customer support
//! service, or perhaps it's to let a service run transactions on your
//! behalf etc.
//!
//! When using [subsidize_with_allowance] note the following:
//!
//! - If you're using an Accumulating allowance, that allowance will
//! be reduced by the amount you specify in the function call
//! regardless of how much actually gets spent on the subsidy. This is
//! because the component cannot know how much in fees you actually
//! end up paying. For example if you specify max 10 XRD in the
//! function call and only 5 XRD gets spent, the allowance remaining
//! amount is nevertheless reduced by 10 XRD.
//!
//! - Failed subsidized transactions will pull funds from your escrow
//! pool but this will not be reflected in the Allowance itself since
//! failed transactions cause no on-ledger changes apart from tx
//! cost. This means that a malicious allowance holder for XRD can use
//! it to drain your XRD by spamming failing transactions. For this
//! reason only issue XRD allowances to parties you can trust to be
//! honest. (This problem could be mitigated by introducing
//! configuration parameters to allow/disallow subsidies but the
//! current implementation is more intended to be a tech demo than a
//! fully deployable product and so this has not been done.)
//!
//! # Automatic Allowance issuance
//!
//! You can maintain a list of trusted parties who will automatically
//! receive Allowances whenever they deposit funds into your
//! account. You may use this if you have multiple different services
//! interacting with your Escrow pool (different market places
//! perhaps) and you want each such service to be able to take back
//! out funds they put in, in order to spend them on services or
//! trades.
//!
//! Such a party will need to provide a badge with a trusted
//! non-fungible global id, or simply with a trusted resource address,
//! when calling [deposit_funds] and they will receive back an
//! Allowance for that amount of the deposit.
//!

//! # About error messages
//!
//! Many error messages that are produced on panics in this code are
//! preceded with an error code, starting at error code 2000 for this
//! project. They are there to make each error easily recognizable in
//! the test suite so that I can easily test that a transaction that
//! is intended to fail fails for the correct reason.
//!
//! Note that as this is a fairly new idea, not all the error messages
//! have codes at this point.
//!
//! # About IndexSet sizes for non-fungible local ids
//!
//! Note that use of TokenQuantity introduces a possible cost unit
//! limit problem when the IndexSet inside gets large. The current
//! implementation is suitable for a moderate number of
//! nonfungible-ids in that set, but not very many.
